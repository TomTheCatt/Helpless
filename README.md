# Helpless
Discord.py bot for "nuking" multiple servers.

It is against Discord's Terms of Service to use a bot to "nuke" a server. Use of a alt account is recommended.
"Helpless" was created to delete an entire Discord server known as "nuking". Using this program for real server nuking is not supported by the author; and as such the author will not be held responsible for the actions of users.

HOW TO USE:
1. Install python normally.
2. Install discord.py normally.
3. Copy-and-paste the bot's code into a new python file.
4. Run the file in your preferred method.

HOW TO NUKE:
1. Create an application in the Discord Applications, Create a new bot, and swap the token in the code for your bot's token.
2. Obtain a role that allows you to add your bot.
3. Go to your application, and in "OAuth2", select "bot" and select "Administrator" for permissions. Copy the authentication link and add the bot to the server.
4. Go to the "nuke-script" and run the file.
5. Watch the nuking happen.
