# Helpless
Discord.py bot for "nuking" multiple servers.

It is not against Discord's Terms of Service to use a bot to "nuke" a server. However in doing so you mat recieve a ban on the server you "nuked" if they recover.
"Helpless" was created to delete an entire Discord server known as "nuking". Using this program as a self-bot, ddosing/doxxing tool is not supported by the author; and as such the author will not be held responsible for the actions of deviated users.

HOW TO USE:
1. Install python normally
2. Install discord.py normally
3. Copy-and-paste the bot's code into a new python file
4. Run the file in your preferred method
